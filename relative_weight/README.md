# Relative Weight Calculator

- A simple C++ program that calculates your weight on different planets in our solar system based on their relative gravitational forces.
- This program takes your Earth weight and calculates what you would weigh on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune. Each planet has a different gravitational force relative to Earth, making objects weigh more or less depending on the planet

## Instruction

Just run:
```bash
./weight_calculator    # Linux/Mac
